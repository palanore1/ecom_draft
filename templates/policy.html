        <h3>4.1 Third-Party Service Providers</h3>

            protect your data, but no system is 100% secure.</p>

            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request removal of your data (subject to legal obligations).</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> Limit certain data uses (e.g., stop using the EcomDraft App to halt
                processing).</li>

        <h2>7. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>We use session cookies to maintain your login state. These are essential for EcomDraft App functionality and
            expire
